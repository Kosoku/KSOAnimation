/**
 KSOAnimationInteractionController is the base class for controllers that manage interactive dismissal. You should set them on the presented view controller using the setKSO_animationInteractionController: method within the animationControllerForPresentedController:sourceController: delegate method. You should return the same instance from the interactionControllerForDismissal: delegate method only when the isInteractive method returns YES, which means its gesture recognizer triggered to begin the interactive dismissal.
 
 See the demo app for examples.
